Dear Adu,

Welcome to my hidden birthday message, tucked away in the roughly 500 lines of code
I wrote to create this music player for you.

In 2019, hidden in lecture rooms, you would tell me so many stories. Not only did
I love listening to each story, but I also loved watching you as your hands jumped
in and out of mine and your eyes darted with excitement and revealed your every emotion.

Over the next 3.5 years, I learned this was the case with everything. Whether watching
TV and movies, sharing gossip, telling me about your day, or more, your eyes revealed
all the thoughts and feelings your words couldn't carry. I have laughed at, tried
to replicate, and fallen in love with your infinite arsenal of facial expressions.

When I heard this song, I couldn't imagine more perfect lyrics that captured how
I feel when I see your eyes. I texted you immediately to tell you about this song
and told you I would serenade you with it one day. And so I recorded my (terribly
untrained) voice singing this song to convey how much I love you.

You are an inspiring force that has accomplished so much this year, Adu, and I
am so grateful I could experience each day of this passing year through your stories
and eyes. I can't wait to see what the upcoming year has for us as it brings us closer.

 ❤️ ❤️ Happy Birthday, Adu! ❤️ ❤️

Love,

Anu
